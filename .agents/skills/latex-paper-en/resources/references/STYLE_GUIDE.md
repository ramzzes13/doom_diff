## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Complexity
- One idea per sentence
- Avoid nested clauses when possible
- Define terms on first use

### 2. Precision Over Vagueness
- Use specific numbers instead of "several" or "many"
- Quantify claims whenever possible
- Avoid hedging without evidence

### 3. Active Voice (When Appropriate)
- ✅ "We propose a novel method..."
- ✅ "This paper presents..."
- ❌ "A novel method is proposed by us..."
