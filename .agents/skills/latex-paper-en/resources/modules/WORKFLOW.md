# Workflow & Best Practices

If user requests complete review, execute in order:
1. Format Check → fix critical issues
2. Grammar Analysis → fix errors
3. De-AI Editing → reduce AI writing traces
4. Long Sentence Analysis → simplify complex sentences
5. Expression Restructuring → improve academic tone

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Format Check**: Always verify document compiles before other checks
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Apply one module at a time for better control
3. **Preserve Protected Elements**: Never modify `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, math environments
4. **Verify Before Commit**: Review all suggestions before accepting changes
5. Use with version control (git) to track changes; combine with LaTeX Workshop for real-time preview
