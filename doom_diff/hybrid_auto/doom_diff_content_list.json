When trained on the classic game DOOM, GameNGen extracts gameplay and uses it to generate a playable environment that can interactively simulate new trajectories. GameNGen runs at 20 frames per second on a single TPU and remains stable over extended multi-minute play sessions. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation, even after 5 minutes of autoregressive generation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations help ensure stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories, and decoder fine-tuning improves the fidelity of visual details and text. ",

At a glance, simulating the interactive worlds of video games may seem similar to video generation. However, interactive world simulation is more than just very fast video generation. The requirement to condition on a stream of input actions that is only available throughout the generation breaks some assumptions of existing diffusion model architectures. Notably, it requires generating frames autoregressively which tends to be unstable and leads to sampling divergence (see Section 3.2.1). ",

(2021). To that effect, we sample a noise level $\\alpha$ uniformly up to a maximal value, discretize it and learn an embedding for each bucket (see Figure 3). This allows the network to correct information sampled in previous frames, and is critical for preserving frame quality over time.

Interestingly, we observe that while the improvement is large at first (e.g. between 1 and 2 frames), we quickly approach an asymptote and further increasing the context size provides only small improvements in quality. This is somewhat surprising as even with our maximal context length, the model only has access to a little over 3 seconds of history.

The model only has access to a little over 3 seconds of history, so it’s remarkable that much of the game logic is persisted for drastically longer time horizons (see the supplementary for multi-minute gameplay). While some of the game state is persisted through screen pixels (e.g. ammo and health tallies, available weapons, etc.), the model likely learns strong heuristics that allow meaningful generalizations. For example, the model infers the current location from the rendered view, and can guess if enemies in an area are defeated from the ammo and health tallies. That said, it’s easy to create situations where this context length is not enough (see video in the supplementary). Also, these heuristics might be wrong, for example, if the player repeatedly shoots, GameNGen might decide to spawn an enemy, as the agent would usually shoot when enemies are present. Continuing to increase the context size with our existing architecture yields only marginal benefits (Section 5.2.1), and the model’s short context length remains an important limitation. (2) The second important limitation are the remaining differences between the agent’s behavior and those of human players. For example, our agent, even at the end of training, still does not explore all of the game’s locations and interactions, leading to erroneous behavior in those cases (see video in the supplementary). (3) Another important limitation, is that we are not able to easily produce new games with GameNGen. Like traditional game engines, GameNGen interactively runs the game-loop (update state based on input and render it to the screen). However, most game engines offer another important feature which is the ability to easily create new games, which GameNGen currently lacks. ",

We plan on addressing that in a future work; While GameNGen manages to maintain game state accurately, it isn’t perfect, as per the discussion above. A more sophisticated architecture and training scheme might be needed to mitigate these; GameNGen currently has a limited capability to leverage more than a minimal amount of memory. Experimenting with further expanding the memory effectively could be critical for more complex games/software; GameNGen runs at 20 or $5 0 \\mathrm { F P S } ^ { 2 }$ on a TPUv5.

GameNGen shows that an architecture and model weights exist such that a neural model can effectively run a complex game (DOOM) interactively on existing hardware. While many important questions remain, we are hopeful that this paradigm could have important benefits. For example, the development process for video games under this new paradigm might be less costly and more accessible, whereby games could be developed and edited via textual descriptions or examples images. A small part of this vision, namely creating modifications or novel behaviors for existing games, might be achievable in the shorter term. For example, we might be able to convert a set of frames into a new playable level or create a new character just based on example images, without having to author code (see Appendix A.4).

We observe that, as expected, for smaller datasets the test-set performance peaks earlier. For the 70M dataset, the performance continues to improve beyond 700k steps. As a qualitative measure, we also recorded human gameplay in models with 1M and 10M examples. For each model, we used the checkpoint with the lowest test-set loss (see files condition $\\mathsf { \\Omega } _ { 1 } \\{ 1 , 2 \\} _ { - } \\{ 1 \\mathrm { { M } } , 1 0 \\mathrm { { M } } \\}$ examples.mp4 in the supplementary material).

Specifically, we replicate the same frame for the entirety of the history buffer, with the “no key pressed” action. To encourage further generalization, in this setup we train a new GameNGen model where we randomize the agent’s starting location. Due to the noise augmentation (Section 3.2.1), small local changes get ignored. When performing more substantial changes, the model usually generates unseen levels and situations. For example, Fig. 14 shows examples of pasting a game character into areas where they do not appear in the training data (e.g., inserting a monster from an advanced level into an early one). We observe that the model often consistently integrates the added characters into the new location, and they move, shoot at the player, and cause damage. Figure 15 demonstrates modifying a level’s layout by inserting features such as walls, doors, or pools from other areas. The model successfully integrates these into the environment, rendering new viewpoints as the player navigates. We hope to further explore these preliminary results in future work. ",

During distillation training we use 3 U-Nets, all initialized with a GameN-Gen model: generator, teacher, and fake-score model. The teacher remains frozen throughout the training. The fake-score model is continuously trained to predict the outputs of the generator with the standard diffusion loss. To train the generator, we use the teacher and the fake-score model to predict the noise added to an input image - $\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { r e a l } }$ and $\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { f a k e } }$ . We optimize the weights of the generator to minimize the generator gradient value at each pixel weighted by $\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { r e a l } } - \\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { f a k e } }$ . When distilling we use a CFG of 1.5 to generate $\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { r e a l } }$ . We train for 1000 steps with a batch size of 128. Note that unlike Yin et al. (2024) we train with varying amounts of noise and do not use a regularization loss (we hope to explore other distillation variants in future work). With distillation we are able to significantly improve the quality of a 1-step model (see “D” in Table 1), enabling running the game at 50FPS, albeit with a small impact to quality. ",
